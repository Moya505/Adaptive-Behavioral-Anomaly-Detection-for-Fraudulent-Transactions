#Research Question:
Can a simple anomaly detection model that learns user spending behavior over time detect unusual transactions more effectively than a static model?

#Topic & Summary:
As digital transactions increase globally, detecting fraudulent activity has become a major challenge. Traditional fraud detection models are often static which means they are trained once and then applied indefinitely, assuming that user behavior remains constant. However, spending patterns change over time due to lifestyle, income, or external factors. This project explores whether an adaptive anomaly detection model ,which continuously learns from new behavioral data, can outperform a static model in identifying fraudulent transactions.
We hypothesize that adaptive learning will reduce false positives and improve detection accuracy by better reflecting evolving user behavior. This study is important because it directly supports safer financial systems and can be extended to real-world fraud monitoring applications.
